                    My name is Hunter Funk and this digital portfolio will walk
                    you through who I am, what I am capable off, and show off some
                    of my previous works. Hopefully, by the end, you will be
                    convinced that I am up to par for the project you need done.
                    Currently, I am a junior at Millennium High School as well as a 
                    first-year coding student at West-MEC central campus.

                    Ever since I was a kid, video games have been a passion of mine 
                    since my older brother put a controller in my hand when he had to
                    leave the room for a second. It has always been a goal to eventually
                    finish my own game; however, there is more that I can do with code 
                    than just programming video games. I also try to keep up with new 
                    movies and anime coming out. Currently, I plan to attend college 
                    and get a degree, but not quite sure in what or where.

                    I've learned how to code HTML5 and CSS3 so far while attending 
                    West-MEC. Later in the year I will also begin to learn the basics of 
                    Javascript. Throughout the year, I have worked with other students in 
                    the program to finish websites using what we know; however, none of them
                    are being hosted as of now. By the end of the year, we will work with
                    actual clients to create websites for their projects. During these
                    projects, I have been both a Web Developer and Project Manager.

                <div id="html" class="info">
                    <p>
                    I have become comfortable with formatting websites using floats grids 
                    and flexbox. Personally, I am more comfortable with grids; however, 
                    flexboxes are required for some designs.

                    Currently, I am studying CSS3 at West-MEC right now. I know how to
                    transform images using perspective with shadows and modify pictures
                    with filters. I can also apply linear and radial gradients to backgrounds
                    to make things pop or stand out on a page. This site itself is all one 
                    HTML, using the pseudo-code to change what is displayed depending on 
                    which option in the nav bar is selected.

                    I have already learned some conceptual Javascript in my Sophomore
                    year at Millennium High School when I took AP Computer Science. I scored
                    a 3 on the AP test and finished with an A in the course; however, it was 
                    a very short program and did not teach Javascript to its full extent.
                    Later on in my first year at West-Mec, I will be working more on Javascript.

                    Many of my past works have been projects given by my teacher. The first
                    I had the content required on the site and pictures provided; however how
                    I turned it into the final product was left to me. The project in the middle
                    was a group project where we had to create an online collection of data
                    on Pokemon. The last was supposed to be a blog for users to submit stories
                    where they had experiences with unpleasant people and wanted to share what
                    happened.
